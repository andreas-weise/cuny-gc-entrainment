In order to determine the speech rate of an utterance, it is necessary to count
the number of syllables as accurately as possible. Two methods of doing this 
were tested, one relying on AuToBI, the other on CMU Sphinx and MaryTTS.
AuToBI offers a Syllabifier that can be called directly from the command line 
to annotate a given audio file. The Sphinx/MaryTTS method is more complex. 
It runs pocketsphinx ASR on a given audio file, feeds the result into MaryTTS 
and uses that system's "PHONEMES" output mode to get a list of phonemes based 
on the Speech Assessment Methods Phonetic Alphabet (SAMPA). The number of 
vowel phonemes appearing in the list is treated as the number of syllables.
Note that this can result in slight differences from other definitions of 
syllables. For instance, "capitalism" is considered by this method to have four
rather than three syllables because of "ism" being pronounced as two, whereas 
"interest" is considered to have only two instead of three syllables because 
the first "e" is silent. Also, the ASR obviously introduces word errors but 
the underlying assumption is that the output will contain a similar number of 
syllables even though they might be different ones.

The runtime of AuToBI's syllabifier and MaryTTS's phoneme output mode are 
comparable (this was not rigorously tested). Assuming a scenario in which ASR 
is necessary anyway, this means that no method is preferable with regard to 
runtime. 
The accuracy of both methods was tested using the "syllable_count_corpus.txt" 
file in the "misc" folder. The MaryTTS system was used to synthesize each line
in the file with two different voices at three different speech rates each. 
Both syllable detection methods were run on each synthesized line and the 
results compared to the ground truth given in the corpus file.
These are the results:

ps/mary:    0.364583        0.614407    3
autobi:     7.343750        3.936549    19

rate modifier: +30% (mean syll/s 6.36 (std dev 0.45))
method      mean abs delta  std dev     max abs delta
ps/mary:    0.208333        0.431003    2
autobi:     2.343750        2.272242    13

The results of the Sphinx/MaryTTS method were better than those of the AuToBI
method in every single test and they were also excellent in absolute terms. 
This not only decides this comparison but it also renders any search for an 
even better method effectively unnecessary.
