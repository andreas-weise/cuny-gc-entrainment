The speech rates in "misc/speech_rates.json" were determined as follows:
    - the lines in the "syllable_count_corpus.txt" file in the "misc" folder 
      were used for synthesis with a ground truth of syllable counts
    - for each voice, rate modifiers were tested in steps of 1% from 0% up to 
      whatever value was necessary to achieve a speech rate of at least 8.0 
      and down to whatever value was necessary to achieve a speech rate of at
      most 3.0
    - all lines in the corpus were synthesized for each voice and each modifier
      (except for some lines that caused http errors in marytts)
    - the speech rate was computed as the ratio between the sounding parts of 
      the synthesis and the number of syllables; sounding parts were annotated
      with praat using these settings: 
          To TextGrid (silences)... 75 0 -35 0.05 0.05 silent sounding

In an entry like this
    "-30%": [3.391398837635793, 0.2334339703128496]
"-30%" is the modifier, the first value in the list is the arithmetic mean,
the second value the standard deviation for the speech rate in syllables per 
second.

Since the inverse function is normally required (given a target speech rate, 
which modifier should be used?), the file "misc/speech_rates_inverse.json"
contains this information.
