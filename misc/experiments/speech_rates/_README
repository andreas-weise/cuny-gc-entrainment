The speech rates stored in the files in this folder were determined as follows:
    - the lines in the "syllable_count_corpus.txt" file in the "misc" folder 
      were used for synthesis with a ground truth of syllable count
    - for each voice, rate modifiers from -30% to +30% were applied
    - all lines in the corpus were synthesized for each voice and each modifier
      (except for some lines that caused http errors in marytts)
    - the speech rate was computed as the ratio between the sounding parts of 
      the synthesis and the number of syllables; sounding parts were annotated
      with praat using these settings: 
          To TextGrid (silences)... 75 0 -35 0.05 0.05 silent sounding

In an entry like this
    "-30%": [3.391398837635793, 0.2334339703128496]
"-30%" is the modifier, the first value in the array is the arithmetic mean,
the second value the standard deviation for the speech rate. The file name 
marks the tts and the voice that the results refer to.
